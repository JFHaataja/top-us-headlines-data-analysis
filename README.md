# üì¢ Top US News Headlines Fetcher & Data Analysis

This repository consists of two main files: **top-headlines.py** and **top-us-headlines-analysis.ipynb**.  

The first main file (top-headlines.py) consists of a **Python** script that fetches the latest US news
headline data from the [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) and saves them to an Excel file (top_headlines.xlsx).  

The the second main file (top-us-headlines-analysis.ipynb) is a Jupyter notebook which analyzes news headlines
from the United States, collected via the NewsAPI. The data is preprocessed, analyzed, and visualized to gain
insights into news trends. The analyzed data is then saved to a new Excel file (analyzed_headlines.xlsx).
